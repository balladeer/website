title: Challenges for the NEF

Many of these challenges have been partly addressed, but we feel can be more
fully dealt with.

**Generalization challenges:**

  * developmental questions (i.e. how did the networks of interest get established in the first place?)
  * single cell dynamics: complex bursting, plateau potentials, etc. can be included, but do not have fully appropriate affect on the determination of connection weights
  * hormonal influences
  * glial networks

**Simulation challenges:**

  * various learning methods (e.g. batch learning, backprop, etc.) could be more completely integrated in current environments
  * scaling up simulations (many hardware/software issues arise here, but they generally aren't specific to the NEF)
